#Crystal Collector Game
This project is a game in which a user is given a 'Target Score' between 19-120.
There are four 'Crystal Buttons', each representing a hidden numerical value between 1-12.
Each time the user clicks a crystal button, the corresponding numerical value is added to the user's 'Score'.
To win, the objective of the game is to get the user 'Score' equal to the 'Target Score".
If the user's 'Score' exceeds the 'Target Score' then they lose.
Wins and losses are counted and the 'Target Score' and 'Crystal Button' numerical values change each round of the game (the numberical values stay constant within the round)
